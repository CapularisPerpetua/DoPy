# DoPy
DoPy (pronounced as 'dopey') is a Python3 based ToDo.txt maintainer.
What DoPy adds is the ability for the user to extend both the todo metadata,
as well as output formats desired (for export or sharing).

## Why DoPy?
In trying to keep track of tasks, there's a lot of workflows. While the
'Getting Things Done' method by David Allen is a very popular method, there
are plenty of less obvious, and sometimes, more streamlined methods for keeping 
track of things.

Personally, I have some work tasks that need tracking, and require being shared
at least once a week in an email. But I also want to track subtasks, I want to
track home tasks. I want to track everything I feel is worth tracking.
