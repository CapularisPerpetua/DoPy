DoPy
================
DoPy (pronounced as 'dopey') is a Python3 based ToDo.txt maintainer.
What DoPy adds is the ability for the user to extend both the todo metadata,
as well as output formats desired (for export or sharing).

Why DoPy?
================
In trying to keep track of tasks, there's a lot of workflows. While the
'Getting Things Done' method by David Allen is a very popular method, there
are plenty of less obvious, and sometimes, more streamlined methods for keeping 
track of things.

Personally, I have some work tasks that need tracking, and require being shared
at least once a week in an email. But I also want to track subtasks, I want to
track home tasks. I want to track everything I feel is worth tracking.
